- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Bruno, but my friends usually call me by my IGN, so i just basically use it everywhere.
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in learning new things, thats why i'm actually trying to learn how to code.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning the basics, like HTML and HTML5 but after this i'm going to study JavaScript.
- ðŸ“« You can talk to me on my Twitter (@bnoru1) or on my Discord (Shide#2136).
